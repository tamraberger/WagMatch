# WagMatchFromHack
This project is currently under renovation into an MVC project.
My finalist project from my first hack-a-thon. This C# code for matching people with dogs for adoption, based on a personality match instead of searching for a breed or age of dog, is intended to go along with PetFinder to help search for pets to adopt while eliminating age and breed bias.
